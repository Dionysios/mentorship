The repo for the mentorship website development

This is the website for the IT Mentorship program conducted by the Software Engineering and Management program
of the University of GOthenburg.

This project is suppose to update itself on every push. Automatic service hook should be handling that.

Something is wrong with the php side of the script ... 
the pull is not working properly if started from php
